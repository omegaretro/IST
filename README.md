# Variability Implementation at Stack Overflow: An Empirical Study

## Abstract

An empirical investigation aiming at understanding how the theme "variability implementation" is discussed by the community of Information Technology professionals who use the Stack Overflow site is presented. A list of 52 words related to this theme was defined based on the literature of the area and the opinion of experts. They were then used as the initial vocabulary for the algorithm that implements the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to find the main topics related to variability implementation, as well as to validate the words in the list.   The most used words have been used to select questions containing them. These questions have been inspect manually and in the end 1962 were accepted. These 1962 questions were then analyzed with the objective of discover the mechanisms of variability implementation more discussed, less discussed and not discussed; what is the delay in responding to the formal questions on variability implementation and how long the discussions last; and finally, what is the profile of Stack Overflow users who asked and answered the questions retrieved, as well as the degree of confidence one can have about the quality of the questions and answers presented.
